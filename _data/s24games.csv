apricot.md,Jungle Quest,apricot,"Rachel Robins, Jonathon O'Connell","Jungle Quest follows a cute jaguar character and a band of colorful monkeys through a series of levels that teach the programming concepts of classes and if-statements. In level 1, the player must fill in the blanks of a class declaration with the correct descriptive word based on the image of a cartoon monkey. Level 2 introduces if-statements, so that you fill in the blank based on both the result of the conditional and the appearance of the monkey. The third and final level continues with if-statements, however, the result of the conditional determines which simple action, such as feeding bananas to a monkey, you must complete to progress. If you complete the wrong action, the level resets.","To complete levels 1 and 2, drag the word that correctly matches the description of the on-screen monkey to the corresponding blank in the class declaration. Be sure to think carefully about the logic of the if-statements in level 2. To complete level 3, peform the correct action depending on the result of the if-statement. The actions are written inside a psuedo function call -> action(). Don't forget to find the collectables hidden in each level's enviornment","![large](/docs/large.png)

The goal of the game is to click and move these blocks throughout the rows and columns of the grid to craft a boolean statement that evaluates to True. After successfully making a row or column that evaluates to True, the row or column will be cleared from the grid and the player will add points to their score. Boolean Bonanza is designed to offer a fun way to learn boolean logic.","Starting the Game

-   Select one of the three options on the menu:
    -   Tutorial (An interactive walkthrough of the game)
    -   Play 3 x 3 (A game mode that presents a 3 x 3 grid of boolean blocks and operators)
    -   Play 5 x 5 (A game mode that presents a 5 x 5 grid of boolean blocks and operators)

Gameplay Instructions

-   Interact with the grid by clicking on one of the blocks. (The block will be tinted indicating you have clicked on it)
-   Click on another block to swap its position with your already selected block.
-   Maneuver the blocks in this manner to make a row or column that demonstrates a boolean statement that evaluates to True such as:
    -   T AND T
    -   F OR T
    -   T AND T OR F

Scoring / Time

-   After making a row or column that evaluates to True, the row or column will disappear and add points to the player's score.
-   The player must make as many True boolean statements as they can before the time limit in the corner of the screen runs out and ends the game",![screenshot](https://github.com/UD-S24-CISC374/final-project-cyan/blob/main/docs/large.png?raw=true),https://www.youtube.com/embed/qgengQMsyD0?si=A9qvKEe1d8bq5z-h,Link to our [egdd](https://github.com/UD-S24-CISC374/final-project-cyan/blob/main/docs/egdd.md),"Boolean block textures: Alex Trexler

green.md,Infamia di Creti,green,"Mantra Yang, Sehee Hwang","Infamia di Creti is a game based on the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur. Players play as Theseus, a young prince, who sets out on a quest to slay the Minotaur, a half-man, half-bull monster at the center of the maze, to save the people of Crete from being sacrificed to it. Theseus must travel through three rooms of the maze in order to reach the center where the Minotaur lives. The game's learning objective is to teach players about Java classes and methods. Players can upgrade and change the type of Theseus's weapon by writing code using provided classes and methods.","Once the game loads in the browser, you must click on ""Enter the Maze"" to begin the game. The game begins with a tutorial, during which Ariadne, the princess of Crete, provides Theseus with a bow and guides him through an example of how to use the weapons system. In the tutorial, Thesues must increase the damage of his bow and once he is successful he can enter the maze. Theseus enters a room with two skeleton enemies which he must defeat to progress to the next room. There are two rooms after the initial room that Theseus must progress through to reach the Minotaur at the center of the maze. These two rooms have different enemies and the difficulty level of the game increases as Theseus progresses through the room. The number of enemies increases as well as how much health they have. Upon death, enemies will drop a weapon, a weapon upgrade feature, or a weapon type feature. The increasing difficulty encourages the player to use the weapon system to modify their weapon.

purple.md,Schedulsine,purple,"Michael Bocelli, Farhan Ohe","Schedulsine is a fast-paced, management-style cooking game where you need to run your kitchen like the CPU in a computer.
Just as the OS needs to strategically schedule jobs to run on the CPU, you will need to schedule which dishes to prepare in
order to optimize your profit and other metrics. Players will be taught about famous OS job scheduling algorithms through
actually implementing them in the context of a Gordon Ramsay-style kitchen environment. Once they have the knowledge, they
can go on to compete and see who can schedule the best.","Navigate to the ""CAREER"" menu to start learning the algorithms. To schedule a ticket, simply drag it to the dark purple area
to its right. Once there you can see which ingredients you need to grab from the fridge/pantry on the left side of the kitchen!
Drag an ingredient to a station to cook it in some way (see the ""HELP"" menu for more info). To create the actual dish, drag a
plate to the service table under the bell. Then, drag the ingredients to it. Click the bell to serve the dish!",![Large screenshot of shift 1 Schedulsine gameplay.](docs/large.png),https://www.youtube.com/embed/hAuW02NNK1U?si=uvf76RmktuGYo8P7,Link to our [egdd](docs/egdd.md),"All artwork - Michael Bocelli

AGAPE is incredibly moody for an AI that was designed to generate languages but evolved into this highly advanced entity. Tired of having to construct machines to generate languages itself, AGAPE now forces others to do the work for them. As glint of help, it primes its hostages with an intelligence test to see if they understand what to do, once they are capable, it is time to Finite Build.","1. Click ""Play"" or ""Exit""

2. Select level by clicking on a numbered button.

3. Analyze strings by clicking on the words that belong in the specified language description.

4. Click ""Run"" to see if you are correct. All green words means you are correct and get to click ""Build"". Any red wrods means you are incorrect and will have to click ""Restart"" and try again.

5. Build a finite state machine by dragging all the circles (states) onto the screen, dragging all arrows (transitions) to a respective circle (state), whether it be itself or another to match the specified language description.

6. Click ""Run"" to see if you are correct. Green ""Next Level"" button means you are correct and get to click it to select the next level.

yellow.md,StackPack Journey,yellow,"Aparna Roy, Emilie Barniak, Samantha Glover","StackPack Journey is a puzzle platform game designed to teach players about the stack data structure and its Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Players embark on a journey to reunite with their lost soulmate in a strange world. Equipped with a StackPack (a backpack that works like a stack), players must strategically collect (push) and use (pop) items scattered throughout the world to overcome obstacles and ultimately reach their soulmate. Every decision matters, as players must carefully determine exactly when to push and pop items to move forward. By mastering stack manipulation, players progress through the game while gaining a deeper understanding of the stack.","-   Use the arrow keys to move and jump.
-   Press 'E' to PUSH (collect) an item into your StackPack. All collectable items pulsate.
-   Press 'F' to POP (use) an item from your StackPack. You can only use items in areas that light up when you go near them!
-   You can only POP (use) items from the **top** of your StackPack, so think carefully about the order you'll need to use items when you PUSH and POP. Remember: the **L**ast item you PUSH **I**n is the **F**irst item you can POP **O**ut (**LIFO**).
-   If you make a mistake, click the 'Free Pop' button in the top left to POP out items from your StackPack, but use your Free Pops sparingly, as you have a limited number of them.
-   Your goal in each level is to reach and unlock the door.
